# Age Guesser

Using books from Project Gutenberg, guesses the age of a string of words.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/rohan/AgeGuesser.git
cd AgeGuesser/
mkdir books/
chmod +x vectorize.py
```

The ``books/`` file should contain plaintext files of the format ``YEAR.txt``,
    like ``1931.txt`` or ``1855.txt``. ``YEAR`` is the year of publication of
    that book.
